Before you contribute code to
this project please make sure you have read the following documents:

 * [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
   This is comparable to the quality of your "handwriting". Make sure your code
   looks like everybody else's code. Install flake8 and use it.

> “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers
> write code that humans can understand.”
> -- Martin Fowler, "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"

 * [PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
   If you find yourself in a situation where you need to make an architectural
   decision and are unsure, use this to decide.

 * [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
   Read this document very carefully and follow the rules.

> BE CONSISTENT.

> If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and
> determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators,
> you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them,
> make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.

> The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so
> people can concentrate on what you're saying rather than on how you're saying
> it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local
> style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different
> from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when
> they go to read it. Avoid this.
