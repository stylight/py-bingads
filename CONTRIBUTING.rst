Contributing to python-bingads
==============================

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy
and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-  Reporting a bug
-  Discussing the current state of the code
-  Submitting a fix
-  Proposing new features
-  Becoming a maintainer

We Develop with Github
----------------------

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as
well as accept pull requests.

We Use `Github Flow`_, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use `Github Flow`_). We actively welcome your pull requests:

#. Fork the repo and create your branch from ``master``.
#. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
#. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
#. Ensure the test suite passes.
#. Make sure your code lints.
#. Issue that pull request!

Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood
to be under the same `MIT License`_ that covers the project. Feel free
to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

Report bugs using Github's `issues`_
------------------------------------

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by `opening a
new issue`_; it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
----------------------------------------------------------

`This is an example`_ of a good bug report. Here's `another example from
Craig Hockenberry`_.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-  A quick summary and/or background
-  Steps to reproduce

   -  Be specific!
   -  Give sample code if you can. For example, this `stackoverflow
      question`_ includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup
      can run to reproduce

-  What you expected would happen
-  What actually happens
-  Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or
   stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

Use a Consistent Coding Style
-----------------------------
Before you contribute code to
this project please make sure you have read the following documents:

 * [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
   This is comparable to the quality of your "handwriting". Make sure your code
   looks like everybody else's code. Install flake8 and use it.

> “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers
> write code that humans can understand.”
> -- Martin Fowler, "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"

 * [PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
   If you find yourself in a situation where you need to make an architectural
   decision and are unsure, use this to decide.

 * [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
   Read this document very carefully and follow the rules.

> BE CONSISTENT.

> If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and
> determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators,
> you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them,
> make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.

> The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so
> people can concentrate on what you're saying rather than on how you're saying
> it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local
> style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different
> from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when
> they go to read it. Avoid this.
